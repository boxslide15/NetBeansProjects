The BetterTriangle class will inherit all of the methods and instance variables 
of the Rectangle class. The BetterRectangle class should contain methods to 
compute the area and perimeter of the rectangle. The BetterRectangle class will 
override the toString() method and will output the instance values of the super
class as well as the values for area and perimeter. The BetterRectangleTester 
class will contain multiple BetterRectangle objects that will test the use of
the toString() method as well as the equals() method.
