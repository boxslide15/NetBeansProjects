The Triangle class will contain three Point2D instance variables which represent the three points of a triangle.
The constructor will have three parameters, the three Point2D objects that represent the points on a triangle.
The class will have accessor and mutator methods for the three instance vairables.
Other methods will include:
1) a method to calculate each of the triangle using the Point2D.distance method,
2) a method to calculate the perimeter of the triangle using the method that calculates the sides,
3) a method to calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula
4) a method that computes the angles of each point using the law of cosines
5) a method determines if the triangle object created is an acutal triangle

The Triangle teser class should contain three Point2D objects for the parameters of the Triangle object, 
the scanner object to record the user inputs, prompts to record user input, and the required output formatted
to look like a table.
